# Project Proposal
## The Big Idea
For this project, we aim to create a personality test that prompts users to answer a list of questions (i.e. multiple choices) and return their personality type and the corresponding analysis & suggestions. The minimum viable product would be a website that directly prompts to answer the questions and return the corresponding personality type. As for the stretch goal of our project, we intend to further elaborate our website (i.e. add some motions and pictures to make it more appealing) and keep track of our website traffic.
## Learning Goals
Throughout this project, we hope that we can improve our ability on integrating the python knowledge and the real life application. We would value this oppotunity on learning what are the feasible opinions to apply python knowledge and how we can transfer our opnions into codes.
### Individual Goals:
Hanlu Ma: throughout this project, I hope that my logical thinking abilities on linking every code and combining functions and html pages. 
## Implementation Plan
## Project Schedule
11/10-11/17: discuss and decide the structure of our project - how many functions and htmls to build, how are we going to use each function and html (i.e.what we want to include)

11/18-11/23: divide the tasks to every member and start working coding

11/24-11/30: finalize the coding part and start working on the final documentation of the product
## Collaboration Plan
We plan to use agile development methodology because we believe it can minimize risks such as bugs and increase efficiency by consistently reviewing and improving the code instead of waiting until the last moment. We choose the agile development methodology also due to the fact that the software/application we plan to make is for the purpose of serving our users to explore more about their personalities in an enjoyable way. And thus, consistently receiving feedback from them is essential and keeps us on the right track. To accomplish the goal, we plan to brainstorm together, in the beginning, to agree on the “big picture”, such as questions included in the test and results for the users. And then, each of us will be responsible for part of the project, for example, one person will be responsible for creating the testing page, building a website using flask, or creating HTML pages. After we have a draft of our tasks, which does not necessarily need to be perfectly worked, we will integrate them and maybe show them to friends and professors to ask for feedback. After receiving feedback, we will improve the code. We plan to have two or three drafts and asking feedback before the final version.     
## Risks
The biggest content risk we have will be choosing the right questions. There are many personalities test on the internet. It is challenging for us to choose them and come up with creative questions from us at the same time since none of us are psychologists. <br>
<br>
The biggest technical risk we have will be using what we learned in a completely different setting. We never learn how to create a personality test in classes but we learned flask and creating forms in HTML. So it would be interesting for us to implement what we learned in new situations. We also probably will learn about new libraries during the project, which will be interesting but challenging.
