# Project Proposal
## The Big Idea
For this project, we aim to create a personality test that prompts users to answer a list of questions (i.e. multiple choices) and return their personality type and the corresponding analysis & suggestions. The minimum viable product would be a website that directly prompts to answer the questions and return the corresponding personality type. As for the stretch goal of our project, we intend to further elaborate our website (i.e. add some motions and pictures to make it more appealing) and keep track of our website traffic.
## Learning Goals
Throughout this project, we hope that we can improve our ability on integrating the python knowledge and the real life application. We would value this oppotunity on learning what are the feasible opinions to apply python knowledge and how we can transfer our opnions into codes.
### Individual Goals:
Hanlu Ma: throughout this project, I hope that my logical thinking abilities on linking every code and combining functions and html pages. 
## Implementation Plan
## Project Schedule
11/10-11/17: discuss and decide the structure of our project - how many functions and htmls to build, how are we going to use each function and html (i.e.what we want to include)

11/18-11/23: divide the tasks to every member and start working coding

11/24-11/30: finalize the coding part and start working on the final documentation of the product
